Current state - development

## Installation

- install Rust
- `cargo build --release`

- for debugging (using logger):
  - `RUST_LOG=info cargo run`
  - `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`

### IMPORTANT

I set up GitHub Actions to automatically compile the app, but they don't work as
expected:
- Windows: Defender falsely flags the build as a virus (even though VirusTotal
  reports it clean).
  Additionally, the build fails due to OpenGL issues.
- Linux: Incompatibilities between different GLIBC versions cause problems, and statically linking
  with musl does not fully resolve them.
- MacOS: I have never tested it, but it is likely to have similar issues.

So, general recommendation - build the app yourself :)
